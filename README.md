# C# Implicit Type Conversion Example

This repository demonstrates a common issue in C# involving implicit type conversions. The `MyClass` example shows how implicit conversions from `int` to `MyClass` and vice versa can lead to code that is less clear and potentially more difficult to debug.

## Problem

Overuse of implicit type conversions can obscure the actual data transformations happening in the code. This makes it challenging to track data flows and identify errors.  The example demonstrates how simple arithmetic operations can implicitly convert objects and cause confusion if not carefully considered.

## Solution

The recommended approach is to use explicit conversions whenever possible, which makes the code's intent much clearer. This enhances readability and simplifies debugging by making the data type changes more explicit.
